# Histogram-Equalization-and-Lane-Detection-and-Guidance
Part 1 is Histogram equalization for a given sequence of images. Part 2 is Lane detection and Guidance of vehicle to left, straight or right based on curvature of lane
Requirements:
cv2 (OpenCV 4.1.0)
numpy
glob

Instructions:

1) Unzip the zip file. Keep the input videos for Q2 and Q3 in same directory as the codes.

2) Keep the input images for Q.1. in a folder named "adaptive_hist_data". This folder should be in the same directory as the code.

3) Run the files using commands "python3 histogram_equalization.py", "python3 straight_lane_detection.py" and "python3 curvature_guidance.py"

4) When you run the file "histogram_equalization.py", note that it may take a while to run. Once done, it will create 2 video files "Histogram_Equalization.mp4" and "Adaptive_Histogram_Equalization.mp4" in same directory as code.

5) After running the python file "straight_lane_detection.py", a video file "output_2.mp4" will be created in same directory as code.

6) After running the python file "curvature_guidance.py", a video file "output_3.mp4" will be created in same directory as code.
